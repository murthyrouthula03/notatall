Cooking Is Creating Emotion: A Study on Hinglish Sentiments of Youtube Cookery Channels Using Semi-Supervised Approach

comments on youtube gives insight for making videos

Hinglish as casual language for commenting

DBSCAN Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise -- data clustering algorithm

Logistic regression with term frequency vectorizer  used on 2 people datasets got accuracy 74% and 75.3% and they were tested.

The current study investigates the patterns and trains machine learning models over the patterns to understand and analyze the viewersâ€™ requirements from the video or YouTube

Sentiment Analysis done.

unsupervised is used to label data to classes and supervised is used to sentimental classification.

logistic regression with term frequency vectorizer gave best results for both datasets.

Question:
--------
DBSCAN used for clustering but it was mentioned like different parametric and non parametric machine learning models used for checking accuracy. what are the variables and response variable?

Opinion-Mining on Marglish and Devanagari Comments of YouTube Cookery Channels Using Parametric and Non-Parametric Learning Models

Marglish comments taken

Multilayer perceptron with count vectorizer

SWN - Senti Word Net used to divide sentences into subjective(has emotions and feelings), objective(just facts) futher divides subjective to positive, negative and neytral sentences.

Tokenization: It is the process of breaking down the paragraphs into sentences and sentences
into words. These individual words are known as Tokens. Tokenization helps in finding the
frequency of the words in the document which directly helps in finding the importance of
the word in the document.

count vectorizer with Bernouli Naive Bayes gave best result for devanagari dataset.
MLP with all 3 vectorizers gave best resut almost same.
